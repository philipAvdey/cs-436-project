# cs-436-project
computer security, semester project. cryptographic keys vs ddos attacks.

Tasks todo:

- [ ] Create server skeleton
- [ ] Create endpoints
- [ ] Create RSA encryption functionality on the endpoints; encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify (?)
- [ ] Create AES encryption functionality on the endpoints
- [ ] Potentially make a hybrid of both?
- [ ] Create a script to launch attack against server
- [ ] Create functionality to measure server performance under stress for all cryptographic operations
